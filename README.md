# Express React Starter
Opinionated boilerplate starter kit for Express/React/Redux/Webpack web apps.

## Installation
The Express server is under src/server. Navigate to that directory and type:
```
npm install
```
The client is under src/client. Navigate to that directory and type:
```
npm install
```
The .jsx files are under src/client/app. Automatically generated bundles are under src/client/public.

## Startup
To start the server, navigate to src/server and type:
```
npm start
```
To watch for any changes in the .jsx and .js and rebundle automatically, navigate to src/client and type:
```
npm run watch
```
Once the server is started and the bundles are generated, point your browser to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```
